	of them chase the player more actively instead of wandering around randomly)
	- Custom: self explanatory
- A new room in the pocket dimension (replaces the room with the floating clouds of smoke)
- Some changes to the maintenance tunnel
- The SCPs that can "teleport" from waypoint to another (such as 173) can no longer
teleport to waypoints next to the player, so 173 shouldn't pop up from nowhere anymore

- Stairs are easier to climb up now
- Some optimization to the way NPCs are animated; FPS doesn't drop as drastically when
the MTF spawn anymore (although it still does drop quite a bit due to the jumble of

so the effect isn't very significant yet

- Random sound clips (distant gunfire, screams etc) are played for a short period
of time after the intro

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

v0.7.4

making them react to the other SCPs

v0.7
- FIVE new SCPs
- improved map generation algorithm - now the map is divided into three "zones" 
("light containment", "heavy containment" and an office/research zone). Due to
this, the layout of the facility now makes much more sense: you won't be seeing 
a toilet or an office next to the containment chamber of a Keter-level SCP anymore.
- lots of new rooms
- plenty of new scripted events, including:
	- scenes where you'll witness the staff trying to escape the facility with
	varied success

v0.6
- Another exit and more endings
- Crouching and hiding mechanics
- Improved intro sequence (still a work in progress)
- Better Class D models, although they're still just placeholders
- Improved MTF AI. Now they head to the last location the player was spotted in, and 
start randomly searching for him. They'll also try to recontain SCP-106 when they
reach it's chamber.
- An injury/bloodloss system, so now it's possible (although hard) to survive being 
shot. Gunshot wounds make you bleed, and losing too much blood eventually kills you.
Injuries can be healed with first aid kits, but it takes some time (so you can't just 
start bandaging a wound while you're being shot at) and a regular first aid kit
won't heal you completely. The degree of the injuries depends on which part of your 
body got hit - headshots are still instakill.

- Ballistic vests which reduce the damage taken from gunshots

- A subtle "zoom effect" when you're looking at SCP-173 or SCP-106
- A console command for spawning items (spawnitem [the name of the item])
- An anomalous duck
- A ton of small bugfixes

- ...And a last minute addition, SCP-096. It's using a placeholder model made by
Mirocaine until we get a better one.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

seconds, causing annoying twitching. Now they're loaded only the moment the MTF spawns.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

v0.5
- GATE B and multiple endings. So now it's possible to get out and BEAT THE GAME.
- Mobile Task Force groups whose job is to clear the facility of the escaped
SCPs and other potential hazards (they still need some tweaking and their AI may 
be a bit buggy at times)
- some new rooms (including the silo of the Omega Warhead)
- improved map generation algorithm:
	- it shouldn't generate maps that are impossible to get through anymore
	- no more of those black "fake walls"
- SCP-106 uses an A*-based pathfinding algorithm, so now it won't just float
towards the player through the map
